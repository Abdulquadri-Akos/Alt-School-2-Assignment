## AltSchool Africa Assignment 02
Embarking on this project is an exciting journey for me, as it involves the creation of a web application with a registration form. This hands-on assignment from AltSchool Africa not only challenges me to convert Figma designs into a functional code base but also provides a unique opportunity to deepen my understanding of HTML semantics and CSS fundamentals.

As I delve into this project, I am eager to enhance my skills in working collaboratively with these technologies. The emphasis on transforming design concepts into a tangible, responsive interface is a key aspect that resonates with my passion for creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites.

The incorporation of CSS nesting is a particularly intriguing element of this assignment. I am keen to explore how this feature can streamline the structure and styling of my code, making it more efficient and maintainable. This practical experience will undoubtedly contribute to my overall proficiency in web development.

In essence, this assignment goes beyond the theoretical realm, offering me a chance to apply my knowledge in a real-world scenario. I am excited to see how the intersection of design and code unfolds in this project, and I am confident that this hands-on experience will significantly enrich my skills and understanding of web development.
